# SHA-256-Reverser
This is a naive method to reverse SHA-256 hashes for basic words or passwords. How this works is it uses dictionary files (which are much too large for GitHub) that include millions of words and common passwords as well as their SHA-256 hashes. When `Main.java` is run, you input a SHA-256 hash and it checks to see if this hash matches any of the common hashes (if so, it returns the word or password associated with it). If the hash is not found, this program modifies the list of millions of words in many ways: it tries adding digits then seeing if the hashes match, and it tries adding common suffixes to all the words and passwords and checking if the hashes match. If this still does not succeed, the program will run a much deeper search which is yet to be implemented. On my personal computer, the first two stages of the search take at most 90 seconds to complete, and can recognize roughly 436 million unique words/passwords or hashes. You can input either a hash or a word by switching the constant value `takeSHAorPassword` at the top of the `Main` class - if you input a word, it will be converted to its hash and will be searched for by its hash (as if the program was never given the real password).
